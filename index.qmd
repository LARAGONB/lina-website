<span class="welcome">Welcome! Bienvenido</span>  
My name is Lina Aragón, and I am passionate about plant ecology and physiology. As a National Geographic Explorer and an Underground Explorer, I proudly represent the Latina community in STEM from Colombia. Currently, I am pursuing my Ph.D. in the [Jungle Biology Lab](https://www.junglebiology.org/) under the mentorship of Dr. Ken Feeley at the University of Miami. 

I am captivated by the unique ways plants respond to changes in their environments without the ability to flee. Yet, this extraordinary capacity may not be enough to ensure their survival amid the looming threats of climate change. This drives my research, which aims to uncover the strategies plants utilize to thrive in "extreme" environments. I also explore how plants respond to environmental shifts in both natural settings and controlled greenhouse conditions. 

Throughout my nonlinear career journey, I have had the privilege to investigate these critical questions in the breathtaking tropical ecosystems of Colombia and Peru, the serene temperate forests of Canada, and the vibrant grasslands of South Africa. I am eager to continue exploring incredible places and uncovering the mysteries of plant resilience, so stay tuned for more updates on my exciting journey!


You can learn more about my current and past research projects [here](research.html). If you want to understand my nonlinear path check my [CV](cv.html) (current as of October 2022).
