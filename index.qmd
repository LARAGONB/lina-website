<span class="welcome">Welcome! Bienvenido</span>

I'm Lina Arag칩n, a plant ecophysiologist and NatGeo explorer from Colombia. I am pursuing a Ph.D. in the [Feeley Lab](https://www.feeleylab.com/) at the University of Miami.  

I want to understand how plants thrive under extreme environmental conditions without walking, talking, or seeing. How do they use available resources to live and co-exist, and how have their surrounding biotic and abiotic conditions shaped their functional traits? I look forward to deepening my knowledge of how plants might respond to climate change and the effects of this phenomenon on our planet. I am most keen about answering all these questions for tropical ecosystems.  

I did my undergrad and first masters thesis projects in the [Lasso Lab](https://lassolab.uniandes.edu.co/) at Universidad de los Andes, Bogot치 (Colombia). After that, I went to the [Messier Lab](https://messierlab.github.io/) at the University of Waterloo, Ontario (Canada), where I did my second master's during the COVID19 pandemic.  

You can learn more about my current and past research projects [here](research.html). If you want to understand my nonlinear path check my [CV](cv.html) (current as of October 2022).
