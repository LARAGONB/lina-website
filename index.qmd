   My name es Lina Aragón. I am a plant ecologist and physiologist, as well as a National Geographic and an Underground Explorer. I am a Latina in STEM from Colombia, currently  pursuing my Ph.D. in the [Jungle Biology Lab](https://www.junglebiology.org/) led by Dr. Ken Feeley at the University of Miami.
   
Plants do not move like we do; they don’t have legs to walk, mouths to communicate, or eyes to see in the same way we do. However, they possess their own unique ways of moving, communicating, sensing, and adapting to ever-changing environmental conditions. I find it fascinating that plants can respond to changes without being able to run or escape. 

As a plant ecologist and physiologist, I aim to understand how plants thrive in what we might consider "extreme" environmental conditions. How do they utilize available resources to survive and coexist? How have their surrounding biotic and abiotic factors shaped their phenotypes? Finally, how are they affected by and how will they continue to be impacted by new environmental conditions due to climate change? 

Throughout my nonlinear career, I have had the unique opportunity to explore these questions in the amazing tropical ecosystems of Colombia and Peru, the temperate forests of Canada, and the grasslands of South Africa. I hope many more amazing places are still coming, so stay tuned.

You can learn more about my current and past research projects [here](research.html). If you want to understand my nonlinear path check my [CV](cv.html) (current as of October 2022).
